    "prompt": "When developing persuasive business letters, it is most important for the writers to think about the readers",
    "choices":["possible objections.", "decision-making styles.","personal images.","nonverbal cues."],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Possible objections. The purpose of a persuasive letter is to convey information that encourages the reader to take a specific course of action. For example, the purpose of a sales letter is to motivate a person to buy a particular product. An objection is a reason for not taking a specific course of action. When developing persuasive messages, it is important for the writers to think about the readers' possible objections and acknowledge them. By acknowledging the objections and providing a rationale that removes the objections, the writers better position themselves in persuading the readers to take specific actions. Because each reader has different personal images and decision-making styles, it is not feasible for the writer to consider these factors if the letter is going to a lot of people. The readers' nonverbal cues cannot be seen when writing persuasive messages.",
